[b]Gambet[/b] is an Android numbers guessing game of wit and strategy. 

The object of the game is for you to outwit and beat [b]Gambet[/b].

You guess [b]Gambet[/b]’s number, and [b]Gambet[/b] guesses your number. 

Both yours and [b]Gambet[/b]’s numbers must consist of four different digits from 1 to 9.

In the onscreen playing section you must select and enter a four digit number that you believe matches [b]Gambet[/b]’s number.
After entering this number the program will give you two values, and these will appear in the player list.
Then [b]Gambet[/b] will show you a number that it thinks matches your number, and two values "B" and "S" that will show on screen.

The "B" value indicates the amount of numbers that you have selected and match [b]Gambet[/b]’s numbers, but in different places.

The "S" value indicates the amount of numbers that you have selected and match [b]Gambet[/b]’s numbers that are in the correct place.

For example , if the number you enter is 1234 and [b]Gambet[/b]’s number is 9385 then the system will show a value of B 1 and  S 0 because your number 3 matches [b]Gambet[/b]’s number 3 but is in the wrong place.

Then when [b]Gambet[/b] selects a new number for example 1293 and your number is 1234 because the number 3 is correctly selected, but in the wrong place you must enter the number 1 [1 digit] in the B value. Then because the number 1 and 2 are correctly selected in the correct place then you must enter number 2 [2 digits] in S value.

If you select 4 correct numbers, but in the wrong order the system will only ask you to enter the B value.

The match of wit and guessing will continue until a winner is declared.
